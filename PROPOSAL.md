**CS 126 Final Project: Ball Blaster**
fd
This project is a single player arcade game
which the player controls a board in a game like pong.
However, it's opponent is not the other player, but 
rather falling bricks from the sky. The player has to 
use the balls to destroy the falling bricks.
The objective of the game
is to hit more blocks and score points before the
enemies, aka the bricks, eventually hits you.

**Why This Project?**
I am always fascinated by the amount of joy small
single-player arcade game can bring. It is a great
time killer when the person is bored, or the 
person simply wants to take a light break from the 
intense programming.

**Background knowledge:**
I will need to know more about how to take user inputs
to control their player and how to add different 
graphics to keep the game entertaining.

**Week 1:**
I will have the player, the ball, and the container set
up. Furthermore, I will set up the basic ball bouncing 
mechanism and add the bricks.

**Week 2:**
I will have added "enemies",
which are moving bricks 
that requires player ball collision to "vanish. I will also set up
the losing condition and add some graphics.

**Week3:**
I will enhance graphics of the game and 
create a start menu and end menu for the game. I will
also have a score tracker implemented. 

**Extra Features**:
I can add music in the game and add some power ups that
can split the ball, lengthen the player board, or stop 
the movements of bricks coming down. I can also 
devise and implement some unique abilities of
the enemies.
